# BDPA NHSCC 2019 Problem Statements

This was not the problem statement released during the 2019 competition, but it
is very similar. The original 2019 problem statement was extended to conform
with the new competition format and is okay to use as training material.

## Key Challenges

This year's problem statements were designed with the following challenges in
mind:

- Interacting with unreliable sometimes-unavailable external data sources
- Implementing or tweaking a non-trivial algorithm
- Implementing an authentication mechanism, i.e. login and registration
- [Responsive UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), i.e. the
  app is functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Observing basic application, database, and repository security best practices

## Statements

There was no sample problem statement released this year.
