# BDPA NHSCC 2022 Problem Statements

[**BDPADrive**](/2022/bdpadrive) (sample) was released during the 2022
competition.

## Key Challenges

This year's problem statements were designed with the following challenges in
mind:

- Interacting with
  [unsanitized](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/endpoint/prevent-web-attacks-using-input-sanitization)
  distributed data sources that are not conflict-free
- Implementing or tweaking a non-trivial algorithm (e.g. multi-user shared
  state)
- Implementing modern flexible authentication based on the native Web Crypto API
- Searching through and selecting from third party frontend libraries
- [Responsive UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), i.e. the
  app is functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Observing basic application, database, and repository security best practices
