  sometimes-unavailable external data sources
- Implementing or tweaking a non-trivial algorithm (victory condition
  calculations)
- Implementing an authentication mechanism, i.e. login and registration
- [Responsive UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), i.e. the

- Observing basic application, database, and repository security best practices
