# BDPA NHSCC 2020 Problem Statements

The original 2019 problem statement was [**re-imagined**](/2019/elections) as
the sample statement for 2020. [**BDPA Airports**](/2020/airports) is the actual
problem statement for 2020.

## Key Challenges

This year's problem statements were designed with the following challenges in
mind:

- Reading dynamically from sometimes-unavailable external data sources
- Storing, sorting, caching, and filtering large amounts of rapidly evolving
  data
- Implementing flexible authentication, i.e. optional login and registration
- [Responsive UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), i.e. the
  app is functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Observing basic application, database, and repository security best practices
