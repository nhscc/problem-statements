# BDPA NHSCC Problem Statement Archive

Welcome! This is a collection of past and present NHSCC problem statements and
related resources.

Each problem statement is broken up into two parts: the primary _Problem
Statement 1_ (PS1), which is released **at least a month before the conference**
and must be completed within that time frame, and the supplementary _Problem
Statement 2_ (PS2), which is released **during the conference** and must be
completed within 8 hours.

Two problem statements are released every year: a _sample_ and an _actual_
problem statement. Each problem statement pair presents students with a similar
challenge, so if a team can complete the sample PS1 and PS2, they are in an
excellent position to do well on the actual competition problem statement.

## This Year's Problem Statements

## Past Problem Statements

Past problem statements and their APIs will remain functional
_forever_<sup>1</sup>, and can be used as training material for future
competitions.
